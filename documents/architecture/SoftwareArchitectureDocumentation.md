## 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints

In this section, all software requirements and objectives relevant to AMOGUS that influence the architecture are covered.

- the architecture should prevent data manipulation via JavaScript

- the architecture should ensure account security

- the architecture should ensure easy changeability and modularization

- easy deployment of individual components should be possible

- backend and frontend should seperated due to further decouple the application

- to further simplify the deployment, the frontend and backend are deployed in separate docker containers

Special constraints that may apply:

- small team with little experiance

- small amount of time for implementations
