## Metrics

The following document provides an insight into the software metrics of the AMOGUS project. 

For the backend the source code complexity and the class coupling metrics are examined. 

### 1. Source Code Complexity

For this project source code complexity and class coupling are measured using the [inbuild feauture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/code-metrics-values?view=vs-2022) of the IDE Visual Studio 2022. 

### 2. Coupling



### 3. Web Application Metrics



### 4. Software Testing Metrics

All about the software testing metrics and the results of the testing can be found in the [Test Report](https://cumgroup.github.io/AMOGUS/Developer%20Docs/4.%20Testing/zTest%20Report/).
